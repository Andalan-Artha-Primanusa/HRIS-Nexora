## 📝 NOTES FOR TESTING

1. **Get Token First**: Login first to get your token using the Login endpoint
2. **Replace Placeholders**: 
   - `{TOKEN}` → Use token from login response
   - `{id}` → Use actual ID from database
   - `{employee_id}` → Use actual employee ID
   - `{payroll_id}` → Use actual payroll ID

3. **Content-Type**: Always include `Content-Type: application/json` for POST/PUT requests

4. **Test Order** (Recommended):
   - Register / Login (get token)
   - Create Employee
   - Create Payroll
   - Create KPI
   - Create Reimbursement
   - Check-in/Check-out Attendance
   - Request Leave
   - Approve/Reject (with HR role)

5. **Common Response Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true/false,
     "message": "Action message",
     "data": {}
   }
   ```
